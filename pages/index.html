            <p>Evita is a musical, including score and music composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics
                and book written by
                Tim
                Rice.
                It concentrates on the life of Argentine political leader Eva Perón, the second wife of Argentine
                President
                Juan
                Perón.
                The story follows Evita's early life, rise to power, charity work, and death.

                Released in 1976, the musical began as a rock opera concept album. Its success led to productions in
                London's
                West End
                in 1978, winning the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Musical, and on Broadway a year later, where it was
                the
                first
                British musical to receive the Tony Award for Best Musical.

                This has been followed by a string of professional tours and worldwide productions and numerous cast
                albums,
                as
                well as
                a 1996 film adaptation of the musical. The musical was revived in London in 2006, and on Broadway in
                2012,
                and
                toured
                the UK again in 2013–14 before running for 55 West End performances at the Dominion Theatre in
                September–October
                2014.

            <p>
                Hamilton: An American Musical is a sung-and-rapped-through musical by Lin-Manuel Miranda. It tells the
                story
                of
                American
                Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. Miranda said he was inspired to write the musical after reading the
                2004
                biography
                Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow. The show draws heavily from hip hop, as well as R&B, pop, soul, and
                traditional-style
                show tunes; and casts non-white actors as the Founding Fathers and other historical figures.[1][2][3]
                Miranda
                described
                Hamilton as about "America then, as told by America now".

            </p>
            <p>
                From its opening, Hamilton received critical acclaim.[5] It premiered Off-Broadway on February 17, 2015,
                at
                the Public
                Theater, where its several-month engagement was sold out.[6] The musical won eight Drama Desk Awards,
                including
                Outstanding Musical. It then transferred to the Richard Rodgers Theatre on Broadway, opening on August
                6,
                2015, where it
                received uniformly positive reviews and high box office sales.[7] At the 2016 Tony Awards, Hamilton
                received
                a
                record-breaking 16 nominations and won 11 awards, including Best Musical. It received the 2016 Pulitzer
                Prize for Drama.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Chicago production of Hamilton began preview performances at the CIBC Theatre in September 2016 and
                opened the
                following month.[8] The West End production opened at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London in December
                2017, winning
                seven Olivier Awards in 2018, including Best New Musical.[9] The first U.S. national tour began in March
                2017.[10] A
                second U.S. tour opened in February 2018.[11] Hamilton's third U.S. tour began January 11, 2019, with a
                three-week
                engagement in Puerto Rico featuring Miranda as the titular character, Hamilton.

                Wicked is a Broadway musical by Stephen Schwartz and book by Winnie Holzman. It is based on the 1995
                Gregory
                Maguire
                novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West, itself a retelling of the classic 1900
                novel, The
                Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum and the 1939 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film The Wizard of Oz.

            </p>

            <p>
                The musical is told from the perspective of the witches of the Land of Oz; its plot begins before and
                continues after
                Dorothy Gale arrives in Oz from Kansas, and includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's
                novel.
                Wicked tells
                the story of two unlikely friends, Elphaba (the Wicked Witch of the West) and Galinda (whose name later
                changes to
                Glinda the Good Witch), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the
                same
                love-interest,
                reactions to the Wizard's corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's private fall from grace.

                Produced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with Marc Platt, Jon B. Platt and David Stone, with
                direction by
                Joe Mantello and choreography by Wayne Cilento, the original production of Wicked premiered on Broadway
                at
                the Gershwin
                Theatre in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's Curran Theatre in
                May/June
                of that
                same year. Its original stars included Idina Menzel as Elphaba, Kristin Chenoweth as Galinda, and Joel
                Grey
                as the
                Wizard.[1] The original Broadway production won three Tony Awards and seven Drama Desk Awards, while its
                original cast
                album received a Grammy Award.

            <p>

                Rent (stylized as RENT) is a rock musical with music, lyrics, and book by Jonathan Larson,[1]
                loosely
                based
                on Giacomo
                Puccini's 1896 opera La Bohème. It tells the story of a group of impoverished young artists
                struggling
                to
                survive and
                create a life in Lower Manhattan's East Village in the thriving days of bohemian Alphabet City,
                under
                the
                shadow of
                HIV/AIDS.

            </p>
            <p>
                The musical was first seen in a workshop production at New York Theatre Workshop in 1993. This same
                off-Broadway theatre
                was also the musical's initial home following its official 1996 opening. The show's creator,
                Jonathan
                Larson, died
                suddenly of an aortic dissection, believed to have been caused by undiagnosed Marfan syndrome, the
                night
                before the
                off-Broadway premiere. The musical moved to Broadway's larger Nederlander Theatre on April 29, 1996.
            </p>



            <p>
                On Broadway, Rent gained critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Pulitzer Prize for
                Drama
                and
                the Tony
                Award for Best Musical. The Broadway production closed on September 7, 2008, after 12 years, making
                it
                one
                of the
                longest-running shows on Broadway.[3] The production grossed over $280 million.
